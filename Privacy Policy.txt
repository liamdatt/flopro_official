Privacy Policy
Effective date: October 10, 2025
1. Who we are
FloPro LIMITED operates an Accounting Automation service , which integrates with QuickBooks Online via OAuth 2.0 to automate accounting workflows (e.g., reading transactions, creating invoices/bills).
2. Personal data we collect
Account & Contact: name, business email, phone, company name.


Intuit connection data: QuickBooks company ID (realmId), OAuth tokens and metadata necessary to maintain your connection.


Accounting data processed from QuickBooks: depending on your configuration, e.g., customers, vendors, items, invoices, bills, journal entries, and related amounts, dates, and identifiers.



3. Purposes of processing & legal bases
We process data to: (a) provide, secure, and improve the Application; (b) fulfill requests you initiate in workflows; (c) provide support; (d) comply with law. Our legal bases include performance of a contract, legitimate interests (running our service safely), and compliance with legal obligations. Where required, we rely on consent.
4. How we share data
We do not sell personal data. We share data with:
Service providers / processors: e.g., hosting, monitoring, error tracking, n8n runtime, email. We require contractual safeguards and limit use to our instructions.


Intuit / QuickBooks: to the extent necessary to connect your QuickBooks company per your authorization.


Legal / safety: if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or the integrity of the service.


5. Retention
We keep data for as long as needed to provide the Application and for legitimate business or legal purposes. By default we delete or de‑identify data from active systems within 3 days after you disconnect or terminate, with backups aging out within 7 days (unless we must retain longer by law).
6. Security
We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (encryption in transit, restricted access, token rotation, least‑privilege, and monitoring). 
7. Disconnecting the QuickBooks integration
You can disconnect the Application from within QuickBooks (“My integrations” → the app → Disconnect). Once disconnected, we stop receiving new data and begin our deletion process per Section 6.
8. Changes to this policy
We may update this policy periodically. We’ll post the revised version with an updated “Effective date.”
