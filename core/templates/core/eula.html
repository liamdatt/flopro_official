                            This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is between FloPro Limited, a company ("Provider", "we", "us"), 
                            and the person or entity that installs or connects to the Application ("Customer", "you"). This Agreement 
                            governs your use of FloPro's QuickBooks integration (the "Application"), which integrates with Intuit 
                            QuickBooks Online via Intuit's APIs.
                        </p>

                        <p class="opacity-75 mb-4">
                            Subject to this Agreement and timely payment of fees (if any), Provider grants you a non‑exclusive, 
                            non‑transferable, revocable license to access and use the Application for your internal business purposes.
                        </p>

                            You will: (a) maintain accurate account information; (b) keep your credentials secure; (c) use the Application 
                            in accordance with applicable laws and Intuit's developer/platform terms; (d) not misuse the Application 
                            (no reverse engineering, scraping, or unlawful processing of data).
                        </p>

                            The Application connects to third‑party services (e.g., QuickBooks Online, n8n, hosting providers). 
                            Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for 
                            third‑party services and disclaim all liability arising from their acts or omissions.
                        </p>

                        <p class="opacity-75 mb-4">
                            We process Customer Data (including QuickBooks company data) solely to provide the Application and 
                            related support, to ensure security, and to meet legal obligations. We don't sell Customer Data. 
                            Our Privacy Policy describes categories, purposes, retention, sharing, security measures, and your choices.
                        </p>

                            We'll use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Application available and provide support via 
                            <a href="mailto:autom8@floproja.com" class="text-gradient">autom8@floproja.com</a> during 8am - 5 pm, 
                            Monday to Friday. Planned maintenance may cause brief interruptions.

                        <p class="opacity-75 mb-4">
                            If the Application is fee‑based, fees are set out in the Order or pricing page. Fees are non‑refundable 
                            unless stated otherwise. You're responsible for applicable taxes, excluding our income taxes.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-gradient mb-3">8. Term; Suspension; Termination</h4>
                        <p class="opacity-75 mb-4">
                            This Agreement starts when you first use the Application and continues until terminated. Either party may 
                            terminate for convenience with written notice (email suffices), or immediately for material breach. 
                            We may suspend use for security risks, suspected misuse, or non‑payment.
                        </p>

                        <p class="opacity-75 mb-4">
                            Upon termination or when you disconnect the Application from QuickBooks, your license ends. We will cease 
                            processing Customer Data and delete or de‑identify it from active systems within 3 days unless we're legally 
                            required to retain it. You remain responsible for exporting your data before termination.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="text-gradient mb-3">10. Intellectual Property</h4>
                        <p class="opacity-75 mb-4">
                            We and our licensors retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Application. No rights are 
                            granted except as expressly stated.
                        </p>

                            THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM 
                            ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT.
                        </p>

                            TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, 
                            CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; AND OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE 
                            AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE APPLICATION IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
                        </p>

                            You will indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising out of your unlawful use of the Application 
                            or violation of this Agreement. We'll indemnify you for third‑party claims alleging that the unmodified 
                            Application infringes their IP, subject to customary exclusions and caps.
                        </p>
